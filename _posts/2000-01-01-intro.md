I'm currently leading ML and AI at aiara.ai. Previously, I was a Machine Learning Scientist with Amazon Development Centre, Scotland. At Amazon, I worked in Endemic Multi-Channel Display Advertising, which involved world-scale data systems, and deep learning models operating at low latencies. I was previously a Master's student in Artificial Intelligence at the <a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics/" target="_blank">School of Informatics, University of Edinburgh</a>. My specialization was in Machine Learning. My research interests are in reinforcement learning and algorithmic fairness. Prior to Edinburgh, I graduated with a Bachelor's in Engineering majoring in Information Technology from CBIT, Osmania University.

<!--Currently am learning Python, also familiar with Java and C. I've been on a mission to code everyday. I'm an Android junkie and also a big fan of the Mac. I like to describe myself as a minimalist. "Design is not just what it looks like, but how it works"  - *Steve Jobs*, is one of my mantras.
