I'm currently a Research Scholar at <a href="https://cohere.com/research">Cohere for AI</a> working on the <a href="https://instruct-multilingual-frontend-dtjnk4f6ra-ue.a.run.app/">Aya Project</a>. Previously, I led ML and AI at <a href="aiara.ai">aiara</a>. I was a Machine Learning Scientist with Amazon Development Centre, Scotland. At Amazon, I worked in Display Advertising, which involved world-scale data systems, and deep learning models operating at low latencies. I completed my Master's in Artificial Intelligence at the <a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics/" target="_blank">School of Informatics, University of Edinburgh</a>. I specialized in Machine Learning with my thesis - "Investigating Adversarially learned representations to achieve Fairness in Image classification". Prior to my MSc, I graduated with a Bachelor's in Engineering majoring in Information Technology from CBIT, Osmania University.

<!--Currently am learning Python, also familiar with Java and C. I've been on a mission to code everyday. I'm an Android junkie and also a big fan of the Mac. I like to describe myself as a minimalist. "Design is not just what it looks like, but how it works"  - *Steve Jobs*, is one of my mantras.

I love <a href="https://www.facebook.com/varphotography" target="_blank">photography</a>. The other passion being Golf. I now shoot in the high 70s. <!--having picked up the game at the <a href="http://www.hyderabadgolfclub.co.in/HGA/Hyderabad_Golf_Club_Home.html" target="_blank">Hyderabad Golf Club</a> aged 9 years old--> I'm an ardent Manchester United supporter. Being an Indian, loving cricket is in my genes. I love reading. My current favorite author is Brandon Sanderson. My current favorite non-ML subject is  <a href="" target="_blank">nueroscience and learning about the brain</a>. Other stuff that holds my interest: how humans learn, spaced repetition, and meta-science.
